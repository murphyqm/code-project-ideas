title: "Accessibility and Inclusive Design"
---

This resource aims to reshape coding education to better include people who have been excluded. As part of that, I want to make
this website user-friendly; specifically I want it to work for people who use the keyboard to navigate, people who use screen-readers to interact with content, and need high-contrast text.

We are using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) with the [United Bootstrap Theme](https://bootswatch.com/united/) , under the MIT license.

Some modifications have been made to improve this theme:

- Adding focus indicators on navigation items, and increasing border-width and contrast of focus indicators.
- Using higher-contrast colour palettes than the default option provided.

Building an accessible web should be an iterative and responsiveBuilding this web resource is an iterative and responsive process; please leave a comment with the Hypothes.is app, or visit the [git repository](#) for this website and open an issue or discussion.
